# ASR Rules Reverse Engineering Tool

## Introduction

This tool is designed to facilitate the reverse engineering of ASR (Attack Surface Reduction) rules from VDM (Vulnerability Description Metadata) files. It provides an efficient and user-friendly approach to analyze and understand the security configurations embedded within VDM files.

## Credits

This tool was originally developed by Rasta Mouse and Justin Elze. All credit for the creation and development of this tool goes to them. This README and any distribution of the tool are intended to acknowledge their significant contributions and to ensure that their work is properly recognized.

## Features

- Parse VDM files to extract ASR rules.
- Analyze and display the ASR rules in a user-friendly format.
- Provide insights into the security configurations and potential vulnerabilities.
